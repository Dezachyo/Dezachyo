# Hi, I'm Or Dezachyo 👋
### PhD Student | Data Scientist | Computer Vision & Neural Signal Processing

I’m a Neuroscience PhD student dedicated to making sense of the massive, high-dimensional data produced by the human brain. 
My work sits at the intersection of **Advanced Signal Processing** and **Machine Learning**, where I build custom pipelines to decode complex patterns in neural activity.

Beyond the lab, I apply my data science toolkit to real-world challenges—from building computer vision models for maritime monitoring to developing interactive dashboards for data exploration.
